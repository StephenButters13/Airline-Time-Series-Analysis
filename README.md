# Airline Time-Series Analysis for Charlotte AI Reasearch's AI Hackathon 2025
Team members: Stephen Butters, Mark Schwarzmann, Lillian Chen, Jerell Bell

## Overview
This project is about using time-series analysis to forecast the number of U.S flights in the future and Covid-19's affect on the airline industry. This was accomplished by using this U.S. Airline dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yyxian/u-s-airline-traffic-data/data) and using Facebook's Prophet model to build a model that can forecast the future amount of flights in the U.S. We chose Prophet because of it's ability to account for variance in the data, such as our data being affected by the seasons and Covid-19. We added regessors and weights to the model to help better guide the model on what areas of the data to focus on for better results.
